### Project Name : Mind Maze
- This is a maze game where you click on the start and it will take you to Island where you have to find a treasure which has a key to take you to
	main level maze. I have added different sound effects and different animations in all scenes. One should follow coins to reach treasure.
	I have made maze level a little bit tricky to challange player and Island scene is a bit easier.
- 1st scene name as START SCENE , 2nd scene is named as 00-Falling Coconut scene and Final scene is named as Main scene.
